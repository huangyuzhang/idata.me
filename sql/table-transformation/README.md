# SQL: Table Transformation

While working with databases, we often need to transform data from one format to achieve a desired result. In SQL, this is often called data transformation or **table transformation**.

We'll begin learning about table transformation through subqueries. **Subqueries**, sometimes referred to as inner queries or nested queries, are used to transform table data by nesting one query within another query.

In this lesson, we'll look at aviation data and transform it with SQL using subqueries. If you're new to SQL, we recommend you do [SQL Basics](/sql/) first.

## Course Outcomes

In this course created in partnership with Looker, you'll learn more about manipulating data stored in relational databases using SQL. You will become familiarized with subqueries, set operations, conditional aggregates, and more.

## Why learn about table transformation with SQL?

This course lets you get more sophisticated with what you can do with data. Even if you are not doing data analysis yourself, understanding what is possible is essential in today's data-driven world.
