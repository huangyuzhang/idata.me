# Data Analytics

### INTRODUCTION

Data Analytics refers to the use of statistics and machine learning in inferring information from data sets, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight and aiding decision-making. This module introduces **statistical modelling**, **regression analysis**, and **machine learning**, and the use of the R software environment in analyzing data.

### COURSE MATERIALS AND TEXTBOOKS

Slides will be provided after the lectures. We will loosely follow [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) by Barr, Diez, and Çetinkaya-Rundel and [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. Both books are available for free in electronic form. Good additional sources for independent study of the use of R and Python in Data Science and Machine Learning are [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham, also available for free, and [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do) by Guido and Müller.

### TUTORIALS

During the tutorial sessions you will apply the techniques introduced in lectures to solve exercises, both on paper and by programming in R. These exercises provide a good starting point for further self-study on days where no lectures and tutorials are taking place.

### WORK TIME

According to recent studies most of the learning process happens outside lectures and tutorials, so it is indispensable that you allocate enough time to work on the module. The module is worth 15 credits, which translates to 150 hours of work. In addition to lectures and tutorials you should expect to invest around 10-12 hours or one full day in the module during lecture weeks.

### ENGAGEMENT AND ATTENDANCE

Engagement will be monitored in line with the Student Engagement Policy of the School of Mathematical Sciences. Monitoring is a formal college requirement and does not relate to academic issues in this module.

### ASSESSMENT

The module will be assessed by an in-term assessment, worth 30% of the grade, and a final exam in the main examination period, worth 70% of the grade. You will not be allowed to use books, notes, or mobile devices, or to access any other materials. To do so is an examination offence and can lead to very severe consequences.

### STRUGGLING?

If at any point you struggle with the material please let me know and we will arrange a tutorial session or other forms of support to help you with the course. Do not wait until the exam to ask for help or advice.
