10 observations, 5 variables

### (b) Which variables are categorical and which are quantitative?

- Categorical: Hot list ranking, Name of property, Country
- Quantitative: Room rate, Number of rooms

### (c) What type of <purple>measurement scale</purple> is used for each of the variables?


### (d) What is the average number of rooms for the ten hotels?

A(number of rooms) = (30 + 30 + ... + 97) / 10 =

### (e) What is the average room rate?

A(room rate) = (574 + 275 + ... + 150) / 10 = 

### (f) <purple>Which fraction</purple> of the hotels are located in Portugal?

F(portugal) = 2 / 10

### (g) <purple>Which fraction</purple> of the hotels have fewer than 30 rooms?

## Question 2

### (a) Rank the data from cheapest to most expensive

### (b) Identify the median, Q1, and Q3. If the quartiles fall between two values, you need to take the average.
- median: (59 + 60) / 2 = 59.5
- Q1: 158
- Q3: 361

### (c) Draw the box plot and identify the lower whisker as the data value that is still within 1.5×IQR of Q1. Likewise, the upper whisker is the data value that still falls within 1.5×IQR of Q3.

## Question 3
### A manager of a large corporation recommends a £10,000 raise be given to keep a member of staﬀ from moving to another company. Which sources of data could be used to decide whether such a raise would be appropriate, and how?

## Question 4
### (a)
- Android: 17
- Apple: 16
- Symbian: 11
- Nokia: 6

### (b)
Android

## Question 5
Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos. It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you instead consider a random sample of 1000 videos. You ﬁnd that 2% of these videos are cat videos. Which of the following is an observation, a variable, a sample statistic, or a population parameter?

(a) percentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos <purple>population parameter</purple>

(b) 2%  <purple>sample statistic</purple>

(c) a video in your sample <purple>an observation</purple>

(d) whether or not a video is a cat video <purple>variable</purple>

## Question 6
- (a) simple random
- (b) ?
- (c) stratified
- (d) cluster

## Question 9
- (a) normal
- (b) left skewed
- (c) right skewed

:::tip
generally if the distribution of data is skewed to the left, the mean is less than the median, which is often less than the mode. If the distribution of data is skewed to the right, the mode is often less than the median, which is less than the mean.

通常来说，平均值在中位数的哪边，图形就向那边有个长尾巴。例：一个极大的值会将平均值朝坐标的右边拉过去。
