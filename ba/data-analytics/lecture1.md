# Lecture 1: Data

Date: 2018.09.26 10:00 - 12:00

## Process of investigation

1. Identify a question or problem
2. Collect relevant data on the topic
3. Anlyze the data
4. Form a conclustion

## Topic covered:

1. **Data**: values for a set of variables
2. **Probability**: modelling data as coming from a distribution
3. **Inference**: drawing conclusions from data
4. **Regression**: estimating relationships among variables
5. **Machine Learning**: algorithms for regression and classification

## Types of variables

measurement scale

variable:

1.  numerical: continuous, discrete
2.  categorical: ordinal(ranking), nominal

## Sampling methods

1. Simple random sampling
2. Stratified sampling
3. Cluster sampling
4. Multistage sampling

## Three main principles of Experimental Design:

1. **control**: separate subjects into treatments, set explanatory variable to different values
2. **randomize**: randomly assign subjects to treatments
3. **replicate**: repeat entire study or sample sufficiently within it

::: tip
Observational studies are **less** useful since no causal inference can be made based on their findings.

## Mode of distribution (ppt.42)

- Unimodal: single prominent peak
- Bimodal: two prominent peaks
- Multimodal: several prominent peaks
- Uniform: no prominent peaks

:::tip

- weight of adult males: **unimodal** (normal distribution)
- birthdays of people in this room: **uniform**
  :::

## Asymmetry of a distribution (ppt.43)

- Positive or right skewed
- Negative or left skewed
- Symmetric

:::tip ppt.55
Median and IQR more robust to skewness and outliers than mean and stadard deviation
