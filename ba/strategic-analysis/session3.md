# Session 3: Resources and capabilities

## The resources-based view (ppt.6)

- **Resources** are the assets that organisations have or can call upon

  - in other words, **“what we have”**

- **Capabilities** are the ways those assets are deployed systematically and effectively

  - in other words, **“what we are able to do”**

- **Competences** are the very distinct capabilities of an organisation that can be associated with long term survival and competitive advantage
  - in other words, **“what we do well”**

## Threshold resources and capabilities (ppt.9)

**Threshold resources and capabilities** are those needed for an organisation to meet the necessary requirements to compete in a given market and achieve parity with competitors

:::tip
Threshold resources and capabilities are must to have in order to exist in the market.

Distinctive capabilities are things required to achieve competitive advantage.

(ppt.11)

## Distinctive resources and capabilities or core competences (ppt.10)

- **Distinctive capabilities** are those that critically underpin competitive advantage and that others cannot imitate or obtain

  - Also known as winners

- **Core competences** are the **linked set** of skills, activities and resources that, together:

  - Deliver customer value
  - Differentiate a business from its competitors
  - Potentially, can be extended and developed as markets change or new opportunities arise

In other words, the **very unique thing** about your organisation!

## VRIO framework (ppt.13~20)

The four key criteria by which capabilities can be assessed in terms of providing a basis for achieving **sustainable** competitive advantage.

|       | VRIO Framework                                                                                                                                                |
| :---: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **V** | **Value:** Do resources and capabilities exist that are valued by customers and enable the organization to respond to environmental opportunities or threats? |
| **R** | **Rarity:** Do resources and capabilities exist that no (or few) competitors possess?                                                                         |
| **I** | **Inimitability:** Are resources and capabilities difficult and costly for competitors to obtain and imitate?                                                 |
| **O** | **Organisational support:** Is the organisation appropriately organised to exploit the resources and capabilities?                                            |

table in ppt.19

| Valuable? | Rare? | Costly to imitate? | Exploited by the organisation? | competitive implication           |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| No        |       |                    |                                | competitive disadvantage          |
| Yes       | No    |                    |                                | Competitive parity                |
| Yes       | Yes   | No                 |                                | Temporary competitive advantage   |
| Yes       | Yes   | Yes                | No                             | Unexploited competitive advantage |
| Yes       | Yes   | Yes                | Yes                            | Sustained competitive advantage   |

# Diagnosing and develiping capabilities

## Redundant capabilities

Capabilities, however effective in the past, can become less relevant as industries evolve and

e.g. legacy IT, outdated equipment, less functional facilities, human resource management issues

## Operational or ordinary capabilities (ppt.24)

(internal strategy)

## Dynamic capabilities (ppt.25~27)

## Developing capabilities internally or externally (ppt.28)

## Diagnosing capabilities: benchmarking (ppt.29)

Benchmarking is a means of understanding how an organisation compares with others – typically competitors (music festival)
