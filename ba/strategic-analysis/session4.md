# Session 4: Innovation, business strategy and business models

## Strategic business units (ppt.7)

A strategic business unit (SBU) supplies goods or services for a distinct domain of activity

策略性事业单位：亚马逊中国，星巴克欧洲，谷歌英国...

## Generic competitive strategies (ppt.9~10)

## Cost-leadership strategy (ppt.11)

Cost-leaders need large market share, low margin and sell enough.

- Lower input costs
- Economies of scale
- Experience
- Product process and design
- Fixed assets
- Effective distribution channels

## Differentiation strategies (ppt.14~15)

**Differentiation** involves uniqueness along some dimension that is sufficiently valued by customers to allow a price premium

### Key drivers of differentiation

- **Product and service attributes** – providing better or unique features (e.g. Apple or Dyson)

- **Customer relationships** – customer service and responsiveness (e.g. Zalando); customisation (e.g. SAP) or marketing and reputation (e.g. Coca Cola)

- **Complements** – building on linkages with other products/services (Apple and iTunes)

## Focus strategies (ppt.16)

A **focus strategy** targets a narrow segment of domain of an activity and tailors its products or services to the needs of that specific segment to the exclusion of others.

## Hybrid - combining generic strategies (ppt.19)

A **hybrid strategy** combines different generic strategies

eg: IKEA (both cost-leader & differentiator)

## Strategy clock: differentiation (ppt.21~26)

## Strategic lock-in

**Strategic lock-in** is where users become dependent on a supplier and are unable to use another supplier without substantial switching costs

Lock-in can be achieved in two main ways:

- Controlling **complementary products or services**, e.g. cheap razors that only work with one type of blade
- Creating a **proprietary industry standard**, e.g. Microsoft with its Windows operating system

## Business model

A business model describes a value proposition for customers and other participants, an arrangement of activities that produces this value and associated revenue and cost structures

### Examples of successful general business models (ppt.31)

- **Razor and blade** – named after the classic Gillette strategy of selling razors cheaply and profiting from sales of high priced blades (mobile devices, ink-jet printers).

- **Freemium** – named by combining ‘free’ and ‘premium’. Basic services are free or near free to attract customers who then upgrade to more expensive premium services (e.g. Spotify).

- **Multi-sided platforms** – bringing together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers (e.g. Uber, video games, Google search, 淘宝, 饿了么, Uber Eat).

## Innovation

- **Innovation** involves the conversion of new knowledge into a new product, process or service and the putting of this new product, process or service into actual commercial use.

- Innovation is more complex than **invention** (i.e. the conversion of new knowledge into a new product, process or service) – putting the invention into use can be the most challenging part of the process.

## Innovation dilemmas (ppt.43~47)

- **Technology push** is the view that it is the new knowledge created by technologists or scientists that pushes the innovation process.(技术创造改变)
- **Market pull** is the view that it is the pull of users in the market that is responsible for innovation. ‘Lead users’ are of particular importance.（市场促进改变）

---

- **Product innovation** relates to the final product (or service) to be sold, especially with regard to its features. (eg. Mac)
- **Process innovation** relates to the way in which a product is produced and distributed, especially with regard to improvements in cost or reliability. (eg. Dell - customization)

---

- **Closed innovation** is the traditional approach to innovation relying on the organisation’s own internal resources, e.g. research and marketing departments
- **Open innovation** involves the deliberate import and export of knowledge by an organisation in order to accelerate and enhance its innovation
