# Strategic Analysis Coursework 1

音乐节在过去的几十年中发展迅速，以 Glastonbury 音乐节为代表的主流音乐节成为了音乐产业的支柱。这篇报告通过 VRIO 模型分析了 Glastonbury 音乐节的资源与能力，阐明了 Glastonbury 的成功源自于这几种资源：————，————，————。并阐述大数据及数据分析将重塑音乐产业的可能性。

## Q3: Important Resources & Capabilities

### History and Brand Name

As one of the oldest music festivals in the world, Glastonbury has established an extremely strong brand identity amongst music festival goers around the world. It is considered as its core competency.

It is also well-known that part of the profit is given to charities which further adds to its brand and reputation. Many artists have a desire to play at the festival purely based on the brand name and the number of attendees. Therefore, we can say that the brand name is Valuable to Glastonbury. In addition to being Rare, it’s very difficult and takes time for others to Imitate and obviously, it is exploited by Glastonbury pretty well.

`in the context of the experience economy and social media.`

Nowadays social media plays a significant part in consumers' decision-making. The communication between consumers and organizers is mutual: consumers can easily have information about the festival with bare cost. For the festival organizers have the option to engage with attendees and potential attendees proactively.

That raises a question about transparency. It is essential for festival organizers to properly handle negative comments from attendees and iterate the services quickly.

Glastonbury 利用 social media 来养粉丝，效果非常好（twitter 粉丝数量），这 reinforces 它的 brand 和 reputation。

For events, people would spend certain time on social media

### Comprehensive Service Portfolio

音乐节的特性决定了参与者的主观体验变得重要，Gelder & Robinson (2009) concluded 指出参与者与会与否取决于多种动机，因此如果音乐节仅仅依赖于节目本身是有风险的。同样重要的是营造一种有趣的节日氛围，提供充足的社交机会，并提供多种多样的以及非音乐的体验。 Glastonbury 很好的在其发展过程中了解到了这一点，In addition to different genres of music, Glastonbury also began to focus on other performing activities like comedy, poetry and even children’s entertainments. It is consider this as Glastonbury’s Comprehensive Service Portfolio, which made Glastonbury a well-covered festival in terms of the content, to fulfil different attendee’s needs. This is quite clearly a Valuable capability. When **we** look at Rarity, there are a few other festivals such as Latitude which offers a diverse range of content such as arts, theatre, comedy and literature, however, its capacity is much lower compare to Glastonbury. Therefore, **we** still consider Glastonbury’s service portfolio a Rarity, but it is Imitable to a certain extent, as shown by other festivals are increasing their service portfolio throughout the years.

## Q4: Big Data & Data Analytics reshape the industry

根据 Gelder，虽然 sample size 相对较小，但是他们的研究表明与家人和朋友进行社交是人们参加音乐节的主要因素。

不难想象，在数据分析的帮助下，event managers 可以更好的了解到人们的参与需求。

但是 Glatonbury 并不需要花费大量的支出来提高参与者。

如之前提到的，利用社交媒体，活动组织者可以从参与者中获得更加具有价值及时效性的反馈，节日将可以以此分析受众的兴趣变化并预测来年的趋势，以便让组织者能够更早地进行第二年的活动准备。这能够为节日取得更久的准备时间，从而减少支出。比如：。。。

- socializing with friends and family was a primary motive
- Most importantly, the article supported the notion that multiple motivations come into play and it suggests that it is risky for festival managers to rely solely on the theme of the event itself. It is equally important to create a fun and festive atmosphere that offers ample opportunity to socialize and have new and nonmusical experiences.
