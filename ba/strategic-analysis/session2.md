# Session 2: Environment, Industry and Sector Analysis

## Frameworks for Strategic Analysis: PESTEL

Political, Ecological, Social, Technological, Economic, Legal

## Forecasting approaches (ppt.24-25)

- **Single-point forecasting** is where organisations have such confidence about the future that they will provide just one forecast number
- **Range forecasting** is where organisations have less certainty, suggesting a range of possible outcomes with different degrees of probability and a central projection identified as the most probable
- **Alternative futures forecasting** typically involves even less certainty, focusing on a set of possible yet distinct futures with radically different outcomes. Alternative futures can be fed into scenario analyses though not as simple forecasts.

## Case Study: Supermarket industry's PESTEL Analysis

And the most important aspect to influence the supermarket industry.

- Political
  - Tax
  - Foreign trade regulations
  - Land use
  - International relations
- Ecological
  - recycling
- Social
  - demographics
  - customers' shopping behaviours
- Techonological
  - self-service checkout
- Economic
  - personal disposable income
  - interest rates (eg. consumers pay by credit card)
  - wages
  - exchange rates
- Legal

## Scenario planning (ppt.27)

# Industry and sector analysis

## Defining an industry (ppt.30)

- Theindustry must not be defined **too broadly** (too wide to be meaningful) or **too narrowly** (thus excluding important competitors)
- The broader **industry value chain** needs to be considered – different stages in the value chain should be treated as separate industries
- Industries can be analysed at different levels – for example,different geographies, markets and even different product or service segments within them (e.g. airline markets)

## Porter's Five Foreces Analysis (ppt.31~)

- the threat of entry (ppt.33)
- the threat of substitutes (ppt.34)
- the bargaining power of buyers (ppt.35)
- the bargaining power of suppliers (ppt.36)
- the extent of rivalry between competitors (ppt.37)

:::tip
Porter’s five forces framework helps identify the **attractiveness** of an industry in terms of five competitive forces. (profitable)
:::

## Implications of five forces analysis (ppt.39)

- Identifies the **attractiveness** of industries and informs decisions about which industries/markets to enter or leave
- Identifies **strategies to influence** the impact of the forces, for example, building barriers to entry by becoming more vertically integrated
- The forces may have a **different impact on different organisations** e.g. large firms can deal with barriers to entry more easily than small firms

## Complementors (ppt.41)

- **Demand complementors**
  An organisation is your complementor if it enhances your business attractiveness to customers (e.g. app suppliers are complementors to smartphone producers)

- **Supply complementors**
  An organisation is a complementor with respect to suppliers if it is more attractive for a supplier to deliver when it also supplies the other organisation (e.g. a competing airline can be a complementor with respect to a supplier like Boeing – as Boeing may invest more in improvements if they are supplying both airlines).

## Strategic lock-in and industry standards (ppt.43)

(eg. apple inc: system consistence, devices integration...)

(eg. supermarkets: membership card, loyalty program...)

:::tip
Lock-in can be critical to profitability depending on how vulnerable an organisation can be to sustaining lock-in
:::

## Strategic groups (ppt.46)

**Strategic groups** are organisations within an industry or sector with similar strategic characteristics, following similar strategies or competing on similar bases. (book.p81)

Bases of identifying strategic groups (ppt.47)

## Market segmentation and strategic costumers (ppt.49)

- A **market segment** is a group of customers who have similar needs that are different from customer needs in other parts of the market.
- A **strategic customer** is the person(s) at whom the strategy is primarily addressed because they have the most influence over which goods or services are purchased.

:::tip
market segment is important because we can know if the market is profitble (a niche market).
